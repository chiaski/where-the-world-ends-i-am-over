        and then i was there
        at the burning.
        
        
        i was here at the fostering of the end,
                            before you had forgiven itâ€”
                            <ol>
                                <li>in this one you and i find each other</li>
                                <li>in this one i was never told the story behind my birth</li>
                                <li>in this one i find solace in a god</li>
                                <li>in this one i am kind</li>
                            </ol>
      
        it's simple: when i was fourteen i wrote about love and wrote
        9,000 word essays on loneliness and infinite and maybe i already
        tasted it all? maybe i stopped feeling somewhere then. i was not
        born into war. i was eased into it. i was almost sufficient, but
        then everyone decided i must not.
      
      
                i am repeating the mistakes of my father
                i am repeating the mistake of being born
                
                                        
                                        
                                        12:03AM I AM SO FUCKING TIRED
                                        OF LIFE OF LIFE OF LIFE OF LIFE
                                        how come  i talk so much better
                                        yet cannot be?
                                        
                o k
                
                you know,
                    i had let these hands bury me myself
                    propped and smooth
                            it's the only way.
                            we clean and empty her
        I was thirteen      then you buy the land
        when I wrote my     and everything taken from you
        first suicide       and find glory swept over
        note! In a .txt        you. i am still alive.
        file in my old
        laptop! I bet
        all those words
        are as valid
        as they were.
